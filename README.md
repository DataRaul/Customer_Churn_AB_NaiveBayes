# Customer_Churn_AB_NaiveBayes

## Sales, revenue and CLV analysis with churn prediction by products and markets in funnel

This is a 3h+ coding challenge presenting customers that purchase 4 different products in segments. The ultimate goal is to use Naive Bayes to predict churn. And finally points for consideration and next steps

I have included CLV, sales and revenue analysis with cohorts being product and market. Since Churn has to be understood within that context for every company to make use of it as a metric.
